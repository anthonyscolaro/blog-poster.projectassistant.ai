## 🔧 Infrastructure & Development Setup

### Database Management
- **Cloud to Local Sync**: See `docs/SUPABASE-LOCAL-SYNC.md` for syncing Supabase cloud with local Docker
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented via 4-part setup (09a-09d) with integrated security fixes
- **Remaining Security**: Minor warnings addressed in `design/lovable-prompts/09f-remaining-security-fixes.md`

### Local Development Environment
- **Docker Setup**: Complete Docker Compose configuration for local Supabase
- **Sync Methods**: 4 different approaches documented for database synchronization
- **Automated Scripts**: `sync-supabase.sh` for one-command cloud-to-local sync
- **Port Allocation**: Following team-wide strategy (see `PORT_ALLOCATION_STRATEGY.md`)

### Security Implementation Status
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ Function search paths properly configured
- ✅ Audit logging with proper RLS policies
- ✅ Multi-tenant data isolation
- ✅ API key encryption
- ✅ Budget enforcement
- ⚠️ Minor warnings (extensions in public schema - normal for Supabase)

### Development Workflow
1. Pull latest schema from cloud
2. Apply to local Docker environment
3. Test features locally with hot reload
4. Push migrations to cloud when ready
5. Use verification queries to ensure security

## 📝 Notes

### Why These Are Nice-to-Haves
These features are classified as "nice-to-have" because:
1. They don't block core functionality
2. Can be added based on user feedback
3. Not required for initial market validation
4. Can be prioritized based on customer demand
5. Some may never be needed depending on growth

### Prioritization Framework
Features will be prioritized based on:
- **User requests** (number of customers asking)
- **Revenue impact** (will it increase MRR?)
- **Competitive advantage** (unique differentiator?)
- **Implementation effort** (ROI analysis)
- **Strategic alignment** (fits our vision?)

### Development Philosophy
- Ship MVP fast, iterate based on feedback
- Don't build features users haven't asked for
- Focus on core value proposition first
- Add complexity only when necessary
- Maintain high quality over feature quantity
