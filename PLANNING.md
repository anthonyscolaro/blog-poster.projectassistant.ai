# Blog-Poster Strategic Planning

## 📢 ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (December 2024)
**MVP Completion: ~85%** (Much higher than originally documented!)

### ✅ What's Actually Working:
- **Article Generation Agent**: 746 lines, fully functional with Claude/OpenAI
- **Competitor Monitoring**: Real Jina AI + Bright Data scraping implemented
- **WordPress Publishing**: Complete REST API integration working
- **Legal Fact Checker**: 600+ lines with comprehensive ADA knowledge base
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-token pricing with budget limits
- **SEO Optimization**: Multi-step generation with scoring
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests for all major components
- **Docker Infrastructure**: All services configured and running

### ⚠️ What Needs Work:
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant running but not integrated
- **API Dependencies**: Large package installation slows startup
- **Production Deployment**: Currently local-only

### 🔄 Recent Achievements (December 10, 2024):
- Implemented Legal Fact Checker with 25+ ADA research documents
- Created comprehensive test suite (3 test files, 30+ test cases)
- Verified Article Generation Agent works with real LLM APIs
- Documented actual vs. planned implementation status

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
Create an intelligent, multi-agent system that automatically generates high-quality, SEO-optimized blog content for the service dog industry while maintaining legal accuracy and ADA compliance.
