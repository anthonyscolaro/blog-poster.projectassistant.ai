- All admin actions logged
- IP address and session tracking
- Data access monitoring
- Permission change tracking
- System modification logs
- Compliance reporting

// Admin Activity Logging
interface AdminAuditLog {
  admin_id: string
  action: string
  target_type: 'user' | 'organization' | 'system'
  target_id: string
  details: Record<string, unknown>
  ip_address: string
  user_agent: string
  timestamp: string
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'critical'
}

// Example audit log implementation
const logAdminAction = async (action: Partial<AdminAuditLog>) => {
  await supabase.from('admin_audit_logs').insert({
    ...action,
    admin_id: currentAdmin.id,
    ip_address: request.ip,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
}
```

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
```typescript
// Protect admin endpoints from abuse
const adminRateLimit = {
  impersonate: '5 per hour per admin',
  bulkOperations: '10 per hour',
  dataExport: '20 per day',
  systemConfig: '30 per hour',
  userModification: '100 per hour'
}

// Rate limiting implementation
interface RateLimitConfig {
  endpoint: string
  limit: number
  window: 'minute' | 'hour' | 'day'
  byAdmin: boolean
}

// Example rate limit check
const checkRateLimit = async (adminId: string, action: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  const key = `rate_limit:${adminId}:${action}`
  const current = await redis.incr(key)
  if (current === 1) {
    await redis.expire(key, getRateLimitWindow(action))
  }
  return current <= getRateLimitThreshold(action)
}
```

### Emergency Controls
```typescript
// Emergency admin capabilities for crisis management
interface EmergencyControls {
  maintenanceMode: boolean      // Disable all user access
  readOnlyMode: boolean         // Prevent all write operations
  disablePayments: boolean      // Stop payment processing
  pauseAgents: boolean          // Stop AI agent processing
  disableRegistrations: boolean // Stop new user signups
  throttleAPI: boolean          // Reduce API rate limits
  emergencyMessage: string | null // Display to all users
}

// Emergency control panel component
const EmergencyControlPanel = () => {
  const [controls, setControls] = useState<EmergencyControls>()
  
  const activateEmergency = async (control: keyof EmergencyControls) => {
    // Require additional authentication
    const confirmed = await confirmWithMFA()
    if (!confirmed) return
    
    // Log critical action
    await logAdminAction({
      action: `EMERGENCY_${control.toUpperCase()}_ACTIVATED`,
      severity: 'critical',
      target_type: 'system'
    })
    
    // Apply emergency control
    await supabase.from('system_config')
      .update({ [control]: true })
      .eq('id', 'emergency_controls')
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Real-time performance metrics dashboard
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  api: {
    latency_p50: number
    latency_p95: number
    latency_p99: number
    requests_per_second: number
    error_rate: number
  }
  database: {
    active_connections: number

  }
}

// Performance monitoring component
const PerformanceMonitor = () => {
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState<PerformanceMetrics>()
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState<PerformanceAlert[]>()
  
  // Real-time metric updates via WebSocket
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.blog-poster.com/admin/metrics')
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
      setMetrics(data.metrics)
      
      // Check for performance alerts
      if (data.metrics.api.latency_p99 > 1000) {
        setAlerts(prev => [...prev, {
          type: 'API_LATENCY_HIGH',
          severity: 'warning',
          message: 'API latency exceeding 1 second at p99'
        }])
      }
    }
    return () => ws.close()
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div className="performance-dashboard">
      <MetricChart data={metrics?.api} title="API Performance" />
