## Overview

This document contains the 2010 Guidance and Section-by-Section Analysis for Title III regulations covering nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and commercial facilities.

## Subpart A—General

### Section 36.104 Definitions

#### Key Definitions Added in 2010 Rule

**"1991 Standards" and "2004 ADAAG"**
- "1991 Standards" refers to the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, originally published on July 26, 1991, and republished as Appendix D to 28 CFR part 36
- "2004 ADAAG" refers to ADA Chapter 1, ADA Chapter 2, and Chapters 3 through 10 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines, issued by the Access Board on July 23, 2004

**"2010 Standards"**
The 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, which consist of the 2004 ADAAG and the requirements contained in subpart D of 28 CFR part 36.

**"Direct Threat"**
The final rule moves the definition of direct threat from § 36.208(b) to the definitions section at § 36.104 for editorial clarity.

**"Existing Facility"**
A facility in existence on any given date, without regard to whether the facility may also be considered newly constructed or altered under this part. This definition reflects the Department's longstanding interpretation that public accommodations have obligations in existing facilities that are independent of but may coexist with requirements imposed by new construction or alteration requirements in those same facilities.

The classification of facilities under the ADA is neither static nor mutually exclusive. Newly constructed or altered facilities are also existing facilities. A newly constructed facility remains subject to the accessibility standards in effect at the time of design and construction, while also being subject to the public accommodation's continuing obligation to remove barriers where it is readily achievable to do so.

**"Housing at a Place of Education"**
Housing operated by or on behalf of an elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate school, or other place of education, including dormitories, suites, apartments, or other places of residence. This definition does not apply to social service programs that combine residential housing with social services.

### Mobility Device Definitions

**"Other Power-Driven Mobility Device" and "Wheelchair"**

Since 1991, the choices of mobility devices available to individuals with disabilities have increased dramatically. The Department has received complaints about situations where individuals with mobility disabilities have utilized devices not designed primarily for use by an individual with a mobility disability, including the Segway® Personal Transporter, golf cars, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and other locomotion devices.

#### Two-Tiered Definitional Approach

The Department adopted a two-tiered mobility device definition that defines "wheelchair" separately from "other power-driven mobility device." This approach:

1. **Preserves protection** for users of traditional wheelchairs and manually-powered mobility aids
2. **Recognizes innovation** - human ingenuity, personal choice, and new technologies have led to devices that may be beneficial for individuals with certain mobility disabilities
3. **Provides guidance** to public accommodations for assessing whether reasonable modifications can be made to permit other power-driven mobility devices

**Benefits of Two-Tiered Approach:**
- Wheelchairs always accommodated without assessment
- Public accommodations can conduct assessments for other power-driven mobility devices
- Maintains legal protections while recognizing technological developments
- Addresses safety, cost, and fraud concerns

#### Definition of "Wheelchair"

**Final Definition:** "A manually operated or power-driven device designed primarily for use by an individual with a mobility disability for the main purpose of indoor or of both indoor and outdoor locomotion."

**Key Changes from Proposed Rule:**
- Changed from "solely designed" to "primarily designed" to cover devices that may have temporary use applications
- Removed "typical indoor and outdoor pedestrian areas" as too vague
- Uses "mobility disability" instead of "mobility impairments" for broader coverage including circulatory and respiratory disabilities

**Devices Included:**
- Manually-operated and power-driven wheelchairs
- Mobility scooters (typically single-user, three to four wheels, appropriate for indoor and outdoor pedestrian areas)
- Wheelchairs with individualized or unique features
- Models with different numbers of wheels

#### Segway® Personal Transporter Categorization

The Department decided **NOT** to include the Segway® PT in the definition of "wheelchair" based on:

1. **Intended Use Determinant:** The device's intended use is the appropriate determinant for categorization
2. **Design Purpose:** Segway® PT was not designed primarily for individuals with mobility disabilities
3. **Safety Concerns:** Higher speeds (up to 12.5 mph vs. 6 mph for power wheelchairs), different user posture, and operational characteristics
4. **Fraud Prevention:** Devices designed primarily for individuals with disabilities are less subject to fraud concerns

#### Assessment Factors for Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices

Under § 36.311(b)(2), public accommodations must consider these factors when evaluating other power-driven mobility devices:

1. **Device characteristics:** Type, size, weight, dimensions, and speed
2. **Facility factors:** Volume of pedestrian traffic, design and operational characteristics
3. **Safety requirements:** Whether the device conflicts with legitimate safety requirements
4. **Environmental impact:** Whether the device poses substantial risk of serious harm to immediate environment, natural or cultural resources
5. **Legal compliance:** Whether use conflicts with Federal land management laws or regulations

## Service Animal Provisions in Title III Context

While the scraped content focuses heavily on mobility devices, the Title III regulations also contain important service animal provisions that mirror those in Title II, including:

- Definition of service animals as individually trained dogs
- Accommodation requirements for public accommodations
- Exclusion criteria and assessment procedures
- Relationship to other federal laws

## Legal Framework

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. 12181-12189 (Title III of the ADA)

**Regulatory Citation:** 28 CFR Part 36

**Effective Date:** The 2010 revisions became effective with phased implementation beginning March 15, 2011

## Enforcement and Compliance

Public accommodations covered by Title III include:
- Restaurants, movie theaters, schools
- Day care facilities, recreational facilities
- Doctors' offices and medical facilities
- Hotels, retail establishments
- Other businesses generally open to the public

These entities must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to accommodate individuals with disabilities, including those who use service animals.

## Relationship to Other Laws

Title III works in conjunction with:
- **Fair Housing Act:** Different standards may apply for residential settings
- **Air Carrier Access Act:** Different service animal definitions for air travel
- **State and Local Laws:** May provide broader protections than federal ADA requirements
