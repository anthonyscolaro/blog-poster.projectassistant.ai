If you believe that you or someone else was discriminated against based on a disability, you can file an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complaint against:

### State and Local Government Entities
- Public hospitals
- Public schools  
- Other state or local government programs

### Private Businesses That Serve the Public
- Restaurants
- Doctor's offices
- Shops
- Hotels

## Where and How to File Your Complaint

The nature of your complaint determines where you should file it. The information below tells you where and how to file your complaint.

## After You File a Complaint

### Possible Actions by DOJ

We might refer your complaint to:
- The ADA Mediation Program
- A federal agency that handles the types of issues your complaint raises

We could also:
- Contact you for more information
- Investigate your complaint, which could lead to a settlement or a lawsuit

**Important Note**: Unfortunately, we cannot investigate every complaint. We will let you know if we are unable to mediate, refer, or investigate your complaint.

### Timeline and Communication

#### When You Will Hear From Us
- Review can take up to **three months**
- If you have not heard from us after three months, you can call the ADA Information Line to check your complaint's status
- ADA Information Line: 800-514-0301 (voice) or 1-833-610-1264 (TTY)

#### Value of Your Complaint
Even if we do not take any formal action, your complaint provides us with valuable information, helping us find issues affecting multiple people or communities, and helping us understand emerging trends and topics.

## ADA Mediation Program

The ADA Mediation Program is an important part of ADA compliance and does not involve the courts. 

### Key Features:
- **Voluntary and Confidential**: Participation is voluntary for both parties
- **Impartial Process**: Involves meetings between you, the organization you complained about, and an impartial mediator
- **Goal**: Designed to help you reach a mutual agreement
- **Benefits**: Can be a fair and quick way to resolve ADA complaints

### Process:
If we think that your complaint might be a good fit for mediation, we will contact you and the organization you complained about. We will ask if you are both willing to participate in mediation.

## Investigation Process

### If DOJ Investigates Your Complaint:

1. **Contact**: An investigator or attorney will contact you to get more information
2. **Privacy Protection**: The Department will not give your name or other personal information to anyone unless it is necessary for enforcement activities or is required by law
