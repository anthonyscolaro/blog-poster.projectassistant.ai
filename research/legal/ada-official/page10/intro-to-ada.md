The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability just as other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. The ADA guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to enjoy employment opportunities, purchase goods and services, and participate in state and local government programs.

## The ADA Protects People with Disabilities

A person with a disability is someone who:

*   has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,
*   has a history or record of such an impairment (such as cancer that is in remission), or
*   is perceived by others as having such an impairment (such as a person who has scars from a severe burn).

If a person falls into any of these categories, the ADA protects them. Because the ADA is a law, and not a benefit program, you do not need to apply for coverage.

### What does _substantially limits_ mean?

The term "substantially limits" is interpreted broadly and is not meant to be a demanding standard. But not every condition will meet this standard. An example of a condition that is not substantially limiting is a mild allergy to pollen.

### What does _major life activities_ mean?

Major life activities are the kind of activities that you do every day, including your body's own internal processes. There are many major life activities in addition to the examples listed here. Some examples include:

*   Actions like eating, sleeping, speaking, and breathing
*   Movements like walking, standing, lifting, and bending
*   Cognitive functions like thinking and concentrating
*   Sensory functions like seeing and hearing
*   Tasks like working, reading, learning, and communicating
*   The operation of major bodily functions like circulation, reproduction, and individual organs

### Examples of Disabilities

There is a wide variety of disabilities, and the ADA regulations do not list all of them. Some disabilities are visible and some are not. Some examples of disabilities include:

*   Cancer
*   Diabetes
*   Post-traumatic stress disorder
*   HIV
*   Autism
*   Cerebral palsy
*   Deafness or hearing loss
*   Blindness or low vision
*   Epilepsy
*   Mobility disabilities such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair, walker, or cane
*   Intellectual disabilities
*   Major depressive disorder
*   Traumatic brain injury

The ADA covers many other disabilities not listed here.

## The ADA Prohibits Disability Discrimination in Many Areas of Life

To prevent discrimination against people with disabilities, the ADA sets out requirements that apply to many of the situations you encounter in everyday life. Employers, state and local governments, businesses that are open to the public, commercial facilities, transportation providers, and telecommunication companies all have to follow the requirements of the ADA.

**The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability.**

Under the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate against someone because of their disability.

For example, a fitness center could not exclude a person who uses a wheelchair from a workout class because they cannot do all of the exercises in the same way.

However, a local rec center might only be open to people who live in the surrounding zip code. If the rec center refused access to a person with epilepsy because that person lived in a different zip code, that would not be a violation of the ADA because the rec center would not be discriminating on the basis of the person's disability.

## ADA Title Structure and Requirements

The ADA is broken up into five different sections, which are called titles. Different titles set out the requirements for different kinds of organizations.

### Title I: Employment

**Section of the ADA:** Title I

**Applies to:** employers that have 15 or more employees, including state/local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions.

**General requirement:** Employers must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the employment-related opportunities available to others. This includes things like recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, and social activities.

The ADA includes specific requirements for employers to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to employment. Learn more about these requirements on the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's guidance for employers](https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination).

**How to file a complaint:** [File a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/filing-charge-discrimination).

### Title II, Subtitle A: State and Local Government

*   Voting
*   Emergency services
*   Town meetings

The ADA applies to state and local governments even if:

*   the state or local government is small or
*   they receive money from the federal government.

**General requirement:** State and local governments must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from all of their programs, services, and activities.

The ADA contains specific requirements for state and local governments to ensure equal access for people with disabilities. Learn about these requirements in the [State and Local Government Primer](https://www.ada.gov/resources/title-ii-primer/).

*   Authorizing courts to award attorneys' fees to the winning party in a lawsuit under the ADA

## Other Disability Rights Laws

Although the ADA applies to many areas of life, it does not cover everything. In some situations, disability discrimination is prohibited by laws other than the ADA.

### Fair Housing Act
While the ADA applies to certain types of housing (e.g., housing at private and public universities and public housing programs), the Fair Housing Act applies to many types of housing, both public and privately owned, including housing covered by the ADA.

*   If you have a complaint about disability discrimination under the Fair Housing Act: [File a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint).

### Air Carrier Access Act
Disability discrimination during air travel is prohibited by the Air Carriers Access Act.

*   If you have a complaint about disability discrimination during air travel: [File a complaint with the Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/complaints-alleging-discriminatory-treatment-against-disabled-travelers).

### Religious Organizations
Religious organizations are exempt from the requirements of Title III of the ADA. For information about how the ADA's employment obligations apply to religious entities, visit the EEOC's website. Additionally, religious groups or organizations may still have to comply with state/local building codes or other laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability.

## Federal Agencies' Roles

Many federal agencies are responsible for enforcing the ADA and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. These agencies receive complaints, conduct investigations, and issue regulations and guidance to explain the law.

## Key Takeaways for Legal Compliance

1. **Broad Protection:** The ADA provides broad protection for people with disabilities across employment, state/local government services, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications.

2. **Multiple Enforcement Mechanisms:** The ADA can be enforced through:
   - Federal agency complaints
   - Private lawsuits (no "right-to-sue" letter required for Titles II and III)
   - Administrative enforcement

3. **Continuing Obligations:** ADA compliance is not a one-time requirement but an ongoing obligation that applies regardless of when a business was established or building constructed.

4. **Federal Coordination:** Multiple federal agencies have oversight and enforcement responsibilities under the ADA, creating a comprehensive enforcement framework.

5. **Related Laws:** The ADA works in conjunction with other disability rights laws, including the Fair Housing Act, Air Carrier Access Act, and Rehabilitation Act.
