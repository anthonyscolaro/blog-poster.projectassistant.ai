## Summary

This final rule revises the regulation of the Department of Justice (Department) that implements title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services. The Department is issuing this final rule in order to adopt enforceable accessibility standards under the ADA that are consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board), and to update or amend certain provisions of the title II regulation so that they comport with the Department's legal and practical experiences in enforcing the ADA since 1991.

**DATES:** *Effective Date:* March 15, 2011.

## Key Regulatory Framework

### The Roles of the Access Board and the Department of Justice

The Access Board was established by section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Board consists of 13 members appointed by the President from among the general public, the majority of whom must be individuals with disabilities, and the heads of 12 Federal departments and agencies specified by statute, including the heads of the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation (DOT).

The ADA requires the Access Board to "issue minimum guidelines that shall supplement the existing Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design for purposes of subchapters II and III of this chapter * * * to ensure that buildings, facilities, rail passenger cars, and vehicles are accessible, in terms of architecture and design, transportation, and communication, to individuals with disabilities."

The ADA requires the Department to issue regulations that include enforceable accessibility standards applicable to facilities subject to title II or title III that are consistent with the "minimum guidelines" issued by the Access Board, but vests in the Attorney General sole responsibility for the promulgation of those standards that fall within the Department's jurisdiction and for enforcement of the regulations.

### Enactment of the ADA and Issuance of the 1991 Regulations

On July 26, 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the ADA, a comprehensive civil rights law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability. The ADA broadly protects the rights of individuals with disabilities in employment, access to State and local government services, places of public accommodation, transportation, and other important areas of American life.

Title II, which this rule addresses, applies to State and local government entities, and, in subtitle A, protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs, and activities provided by State and local government entities. Title II extends the prohibition on discrimination established by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, to all activities of State and local governments regardless of whether these entities receive Federal financial assistance.

Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the activities of places of public accommodation (businesses that are generally open to the public and that fall into one of twelve categories listed in the ADA, such as restaurants, movie theaters, schools, day care facilities, recreational facilities, and doctors' offices) and requires newly constructed or altered places of public accommodation—as well as commercial facilities (privately owned, nonresidential facilities like factories, warehouses, or office buildings)—to comply with the ADA Standards.

On July 26, 1991, the Department issued rules implementing title II and title III, which are codified at 28 CFR part 35 (title II) and part 36 (title III).

## Development of the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines

In 1994, the Access Board began the process of updating the 1991 ADAAG by establishing an advisory committee composed of members of the design and construction industry, the building code community, and State and local government entities, as well as individuals with disabilities.

By the date of its final publication on July 23, 2004, the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines had been the subject of extraordinary review and public participation. The Access Board received more than 2,500 comments from individuals with disabilities, affected industries, State and local governments, and others.

The Department was involved extensively in the development of the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines. As a Federal member of the Access Board, the Attorney General's representative voted to approve the revised guidelines.

Through this rule, the Department is adopting revised ADA Standards consistent with the 2004 ADAAG, including all of the amendments to the 1991 ADAAG since 1998. For the purposes of title II, the Department's revised standards are entitled "The 2010 Standards for Accessible Design" and consist of the 2004 ADAAG and the requirements in § 35.151.

## The Department's Rulemaking History

The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on September 30, 2004, to begin the process of adopting the 2004 ADAAG by soliciting public input on issues relating to the potential application of the Access Board's revisions once the Department adopts them as revised standards.

The public response to the ANPRM was substantial. By the end of the extended comment period, the Department had received more than 900 comments covering a broad range of issues.

After careful consideration of the public comments in response to the ANPRM, on June 17, 2008, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) covering title II. A public hearing was held on July 15, 2008, in Washington, D.C. By the end of the 60-day comment period, the Department had received 4,435 comments addressing a broad range of issues from representatives of businesses and industries, State and local government agencies, disability advocacy organizations, and private individuals.

## Relationship to Other Laws

The Department of Justice regulation implementing title II provides that this part shall not be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to that title. This part does not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any other Federal, State, or local laws that provide greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities.

The Department recognizes that public entities subject to title II of the ADA may also be subject to:
- Title I of the ADA (employment discrimination)
- Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
- Other Federal statutes such as the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHAct)

Compliance with the Department's title II and title III regulations does not necessarily ensure compliance with other Federal statutes. Public entities must be aware of the requirements of all applicable laws and must comply with these laws and their implementing regulations.

### Service Animals and Different Laws

Although in many cases similar provisions of different statutes are interpreted to impose similar requirements, there are circumstances in which similar provisions are applied differently. For example, emotional support animals that do not qualify as service animals under the Department's title II regulation may nevertheless qualify as permitted reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities under the Fair Housing Act and the Air Carrier Access Act.

Public entities that operate housing facilities must ensure that they apply the reasonable accommodation requirements of the Fair Housing Act in determining whether to allow a particular animal needed by a person with a disability into housing and may not use the ADA definition as a justification for reducing their Fair Housing Act obligations.

## Organization of This Rule

Throughout this rule:
- The original ADA Standards will be referred to as the "1991 Standards"
- The original title II regulation will be referred to as the "1991 title II regulation"
- ADA Chapter 1, ADA Chapter 2, and Chapters 3 through 10 of the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines will be referred to as the "2004 ADAAG"
- The 2004 ADAAG, taken together with the requirements contained in § 35.151 of the final rule, will be referred to as the "2010 Standards"

The provisions of this rule generally take effect six months from its publication in the Federal Register. However, the Department has determined that compliance with the 2010 Standards shall not be required until 18 months from the publication date of this rule.

## Scope and Coverage

This final rule only addresses issues that were identified in the NPRM as subjects the Department intended to regulate through this rulemaking proceeding. The Department intends to engage in additional rulemaking in the near future addressing accessibility in areas including next generation 9-1-1 and accessibility of Web sites operated by covered public entities and public accommodations.
