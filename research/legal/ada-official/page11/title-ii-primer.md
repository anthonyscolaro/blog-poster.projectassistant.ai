More than 55 million Americans –18% of our population–have disabilities, and they, like all Americans, participate in a variety of programs, services, and activities provided by their State and local governments. This includes many people who became disabled while serving in the military. And, by the year 2030, approximately 71.5 million baby boomers will be over age 65 and will need services and surroundings that meet their age-related physical needs.

People with disabilities have too often been excluded from participating in basic civic activities like using the public transportation system, serving on a jury, voting, seeking refuge at an emergency shelter, or simply attending a high school sports event with family and friends. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. Under this law, people with disabilities are entitled to all of the rights, privileges, advantages, and opportunities that others have when participating in civic activities.

## DOJ Regulatory Update (2010)

The Department of Justice revised its regulations implementing the ADA in September 2010. The new rules clarify issues that arose over the previous 20 years and contain new requirements, including the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards). This document provides general guidance to assist State and local governments in understanding and complying with the ADA's requirements.

## Who is Protected by the ADA?

The ADA protects the rights of people who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits their ability to perform one or more major life activities, such as breathing, walking, reading, thinking, seeing, hearing, or working. It does not apply to people whose impairment is unsubstantial, such as someone who is slightly nearsighted or someone who is mildly allergic to pollen. 

However, it does apply to people whose disability is substantial but can be moderated or mitigated, such as:
- Someone with diabetes that can normally be controlled with medication 
- Someone who uses leg braces to walk
- People who are temporarily substantially limited in their ability to perform a major life activity

The ADA also applies to people who:
- Have a record of having a substantial impairment (e.g., a person with cancer that is in remission)
- Are regarded as having such an impairment (e.g., a person who has scars from a severe burn)

## Who Has Responsibilities under the ADA?

Title II of the ADA applies to all State and local governments and all departments, agencies, special purpose districts, and other instrumentalities of State or local government ("public entities"). It applies to all programs, services, or activities of public entities, from adoption services to zoning regulation. 

**Important:** Title II entities that contract with other entities to provide public services (such as non-profit organizations that operate drug treatment programs or convenience stores that sell state lottery tickets) also have an obligation to ensure that their contractors do not discriminate against people with disabilities.

## General Nondiscrimination Requirements

### Basic Principles

**Equal Treatment:** People with disabilities must not be treated in a different or inferior manner. Examples:

- A city museum with an oriental carpet at the front entrance cannot make people who use wheelchairs use the back door out of concern for wear and tear on the carpet, if others are allowed to use the front entrance.
- A public health clinic cannot require an individual with a mental illness to come for check-ups after all other patients have been seen, based on an assumption that this patient's behavior will be disturbing to other patients.
- A county parks and recreation department cannot require people who are blind or have vision loss to be accompanied by a companion when hiking on a public trail.

**Integration Mandate:** The integration of people with disabilities into the mainstream of American life is a fundamental purpose of the ADA. Programs, activities, and services must be provided to people with disabilities in integrated settings. Examples:

- A county parks and recreation department may choose to provide a special swim program for people with arthritis. But it may not deny a person with arthritis the right to swim during pool hours for the general public.
- A state may be violating the ADA's integration mandate if it relies on segregated sheltered workshops to provide employment services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities who could participate in integrated alternatives, like integrated supported employment with reasonable modifications.

**Essential Eligibility Requirements:** People with disabilities have to meet the essential eligibility requirements, such as age, income, or educational background, needed to participate in a public program, service, or activity, just like everyone else. However, a public entity may not impose eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities unless the criteria are necessary for the provision of the service, program, or activity being offered.

**Safety Requirements:** Rules that are necessary for safe operation of a program, service, or activity are allowed, but they must be based on a current, objective assessment of the actual risk, not on assumptions, stereotypes, or generalizations about people who have disabilities.

### Reasonable Modification of Policies and Procedures

Many routine policies, practices, and procedures are adopted by public entities without thinking about how they might affect people with disabilities. Sometimes a practice that seems neutral makes it difficult or impossible for a person with a disability to participate. In these cases, the ADA requires public entities to make "reasonable modifications" in their usual ways of doing things when necessary to accommodate people who have disabilities.

**Examples of Required Modifications:**

- A person who uses crutches may have difficulty waiting in a long line to vote or register for college classes. Staff must provide a chair for him and note where he is in line, so he doesn't lose his place.
- A person who has an intellectual or cognitive disability may need assistance in completing an application for public benefits.
- A public agency that does not allow people to bring food into its facility may need to make an exception for a person who has diabetes and needs to eat frequently to control his glucose level.
- A city or county ordinance that prohibits animals in public places must be modified to allow people with disabilities who use service animals to access public places.
- A city or county ordinance that prohibits motorized devices on public sidewalks must be modified for people with disabilities who use motorized mobility devices that can be used safely on sidewalks.

**Limitations:** Only "reasonable" modifications are required. Any modification that would result in a "fundamental alteration" – a change in the essential nature of the entity's programs or services – is not required.

### Service Animals

Under the ADA, a service animal is defined as **a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability**. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability.

**Examples of Service Animal Tasks:**
- Guide dogs for people who are blind or have low vision
- Alert dogs for individuals who are deaf  
- Dogs that pull wheelchairs or retrieve items for people with mobility disabilities
- Dogs that warn of imminent seizures for people with epilepsy
- Dogs that remind individuals with psychiatric disabilities to take medication
- Dogs trained to detect onset of seizures or panic attacks

**Important Distinctions:**
- "Comfort," "therapy," or "emotional support" animals do NOT meet the definition of a service animal because they have not been trained to do work or perform a specific task related to a person's disability.
- The ADA does not require service animals to be certified, licensed, or registered as a service animal.
- Service animals are not required to wear service animal vests or patches, or to use a specific type of harness.

**Access Rights:**
- Service animals must be allowed in all areas of a facility where the public is allowed except where the dog's presence would create a legitimate safety risk (e.g., compromise a sterile environment such as a burn treatment unit) or would fundamentally alter the nature of a public entity's services.
- The ADA does not override public health rules that prohibit dogs in swimming pools, but they must be permitted everywhere else.

**Control Requirements:**
- Service animals must be under the control of the handler at all times and be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents him from using these devices.
- Individuals who cannot use such devices must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.

**Exclusion Criteria:**
Public entities may exclude service animals only if:
1. The dog is out of control and the handler cannot or does not regain control; or 
2. The dog is not housebroken. 

If a service animal is excluded, the individual must be allowed to enter the facility without the service animal.

**Inquiry Limitations:**
In situations where it is not apparent that the dog is a service animal, a public entity may ask only two questions:
1. Is the animal required because of a disability? 
2. What work or task has the dog been trained to perform? 

Public entities may not ask about the nature or extent of an individual's disability.

**Breed Restrictions:**
The ADA does not restrict the breeds of dogs that may be used as service animals. Therefore, a town ordinance that prohibits certain breeds must be modified to allow a person with a disability to use a service animal of a prohibited breed, unless the dog's presence poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.

### Wheelchairs and Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices

**Traditional Mobility Devices:**
People with mobility, circulatory, or respiratory disabilities use a variety of devices for mobility. Some use walkers, canes, crutches, or braces while others use manual or power wheelchairs or electric scooters, all of which are primarily designed for use by people with disabilities. Public entities must allow people with disabilities who use these devices into all areas where the public is allowed to go.

**Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMDs):**
The term "other power-driven mobility devices" refers to any mobility device powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines, whether or not they are designed primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities, for the purpose of locomotion. Such devices include Segways®, golf cars, and other devices designed to operate in non-pedestrian areas.

**Assessment Factors for OPDMDs:**
Public entities must consider these factors in determining whether to permit other power-driven mobility devices on their premises:

- The type, size, weight, dimensions, and speed of the device;
- The volume of pedestrian traffic (which may vary at different times of the day, week, month, or year);
- The facility's design and operational characteristics, such as its square footage, whether it is indoors or outdoors, the placement of stationary equipment, devices, or furniture, and whether it has storage space for the device if requested by the individual;
- Whether legitimate safety standards can be established to permit the safe operation of the device; and
- Whether the use of the device creates a substantial risk of serious harm to the environment or natural or cultural resources or poses a conflict with Federal land management laws and regulations.

**Credible Assurance:**
Public entities may ask for a credible assurance that the device is required because of a disability. If the person presents a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or card or a State-issued proof of disability, that must be accepted as credible assurance on its face. If the person does not have this documentation, but states verbally that the device is being used because of a mobility disability, that also must be accepted as credible assurance, unless the person is observed doing something that contradicts the assurance.

### Communicating with People Who Have Disabilities

The ADA requires public entities to take the steps necessary to communicate effectively with people who have disabilities, and uses the term "auxiliary aids and services" to refer to:

- Readers, notetakers, sign language interpreters
- Assistive listening systems and devices
- Open and closed captioning, text telephones (TTYs), videophones
- Information provided in large print, Braille, audible, or electronic formats
- Real-time captioning (CART)
- Video remote interpreting (VRI)

**Primary Consideration Rule:**
Public entities are required to give primary consideration to the type of auxiliary aid or service requested by the person with the disability. They must honor that choice, unless they can demonstrate that another equally effective means of communication is available or that the aid or service requested would fundamentally alter the nature of the program, service, or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens.

**Decision Authority:**
If the choice expressed by the person with a disability would result in an undue burden or fundamental alteration, the decision must be made by a high level official, no lower than a Department head, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

**Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS):**
- Reached by calling 7-1-1
- Free nationwide network using communications assistants
- Staff who answer the telephone must accept and treat relay calls just like other calls

**Video Relay Service (VRS):**
- Free, subscriber-based service for people who use sign language
- For people with videophones, smart phones, or computers with video communication capabilities

## Making the Built Environment Accessible

### Access to Programs and Services in Existing Facilities

Public entities have an ongoing obligation to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from programs and services because facilities are unusable or inaccessible to them. **There is no "grandfather clause" in the ADA that exempts older facilities.**

**Flexibility in Compliance:**
There is flexibility in deciding how to meet this obligation:
- Structural changes can be made to provide access
- The program or service can be relocated to an accessible facility  
- The program or service can be provided in an alternate manner

**Examples:**
- In an elementary school without an elevator, a teacher can be assigned to a first floor classroom if the class includes a student with a mobility disability.
- A social services office on the second floor of a building without an elevator can provide services at an accessible location or make a home visit.

### Priority Areas for Accessibility

When structural modifications are undertaken, the ADA establishes priorities:

1. **Priority One:** Accessible approach and entrance
2. **Priority Two:** Access to goods and services  
3. **Priority Three:** Access to public toilet rooms
4. **Priority Four:** Access to other items such as water fountains and public telephones

### New Construction and Alterations

**New Construction:** All newly constructed facilities must be accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards, unless it is structurally impracticable to do so.

**Alterations:** When a public entity alters a facility, the alteration must comply with the 2010 Standards to the maximum extent feasible. If the cost of making the altered portion accessible would be disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration (more than 20% of the alteration cost), then accessibility improvements may be limited to the maximum extent that does not exceed 20% of the alteration cost.

**Path of Travel:** When a public entity makes alterations to a primary function area, it must also make the route to the altered area accessible (the "path of travel"), including restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the area.

## Enforcement and Complaints

**Complaint Filing:**
- Complaints of title II violations may be filed with the Department of Justice within 180 days of the date of discrimination
- In certain situations, cases may be referred to a mediation program sponsored by the Department

**Private Lawsuits:**
- Title II may also be enforced through private lawsuits in Federal court
- It is not necessary to file a complaint with the Department of Justice (DOJ) or any other Federal agency, or to receive a "right-to-sue" letter, before going to court

**DOJ Enforcement:**
- The Department may bring a lawsuit where it has investigated a matter and has been unable to resolve violations
- The Department is authorized to seek monetary damages and civil penalties

## Key Compliance Considerations

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Title II applies to ALL programs, services, and activities of state and local governments, regardless of size or federal funding receipt.

2. **Ongoing Obligations:** Compliance is not a one-time event but requires continuous attention to accessibility and non-discrimination.

3. **Integration Imperative:** Services must be provided in integrated settings; segregated programs are generally prohibited.

4. **Reasonable Modifications Required:** Policies and procedures must be modified when necessary to accommodate people with disabilities, unless it would fundamentally alter the program.

5. **Communication Accessibility:** Effective communication must be provided through auxiliary aids and services.

6. **Physical Accessibility:** Both new construction and existing facilities must be made accessible, with priority given to key areas.

7. **Service Animals:** Properly trained service dogs must be permitted in all public areas where the public is allowed.

8. **Multiple Enforcement Avenues:** Violations can be addressed through DOJ complaints, private lawsuits, or DOJ enforcement actions.
