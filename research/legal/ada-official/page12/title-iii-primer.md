The Department of Justice has revised its regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This rule takes effect on March 15, 2011, clarifies issues that have arisen over the past 20 years, and contains new requirements, including the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards). This document provides guidance to assist small business owners in understanding how this new regulation applies to them.

## New Customers Opportunity

More than 50 million Americans – 18% of our population – have disabilities, and each is a potential customer. People with disabilities are living more independently and participating more actively in their communities. They and their families want to patronize businesses that welcome customers with disabilities. In addition, approximately 71.5 million baby boomers will be over age 65 by the year 2030 and will be demanding products, services, and environments that meet their age-related physical needs. Studies show that once people with disabilities find a business where they can shop or get services in an accessible manner, they become repeat customers.

## Business Impact

People with disabilities have too often been excluded from everyday activities: shopping at a corner store, going to a neighborhood restaurant or movie with family and friends, or using the swimming pool at a hotel on the family vacation. The ADA is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and opens doors for full participation in all aspects of everyday life.

## Who is Covered by the ADA?

Businesses that provide goods or services to the public are called "public accommodations" in the ADA. The ADA establishes requirements for 12 categories of public accommodations, which include stores, restaurants, bars, service establishments, theaters, hotels, recreational facilities, private museums and schools, doctors' and dentists' offices, shopping malls, and other businesses. **Nearly all types of businesses that serve the public are included in the 12 categories, regardless of the size of the business or the age of their buildings.** 

Businesses covered by the ADA are required to:
- Modify their business policies and procedures when necessary to serve customers with disabilities
- Take steps to communicate effectively with customers with disabilities 
- Remove architectural barriers in existing buildings
- Make sure that newly built or altered facilities are constructed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities

**Important:** "Grandfather provisions" often found in local building codes do not exempt businesses from their obligations under the ADA.

**Commercial Facilities:** Such as office buildings, factories, warehouses, or other facilities that do not provide goods or services directly to the public are only subject to the ADA's requirements for new construction and alterations.

## Compliance Dates

Businesses need to know two important deadlines for compliance:

| Date | Compliance Requirement |
|------|----------------------|
| March 15, 2011 | General Non-Discrimination Requirements |
| March 15, 2012 | Hotel Reservation Policies |
| March 15, 2012 | 2010 Standards |

Starting March 15, 2011, businesses must comply with the ADA's general nondiscrimination requirements, including provisions related to policies and procedures and effective communication. The deadline for complying with the 2010 Standards, which detail the technical rules for building accessibility, is March 15, 2012. Hotels, motels, and inns have until March 15, 2012, to update their reservation policies and systems to make them fully accessible to people with disabilities.

## General Nondiscrimination Requirements

### Policies and Procedures

Your business has formal and informal policies, practices, and procedures that keep it running smoothly. However, sometimes your policies or procedures can inadvertently make it difficult or impossible for a customer with a disability to access your goods and services. The ADA requires businesses to make "reasonable modifications" to their usual ways of doing things when serving people with disabilities.

**Examples of Required Policy Modifications:**

- A day care center that has two scheduled snack times must modify this policy to allow a child with diabetes to bring food for an extra snack if necessary.
- A clothing store must modify a policy of permitting only one person at a time in a dressing room for a person with a disability who is shopping with a companion and needs the companion's assistance to try on clothes.

**Limitations:** Anything that would result in a fundamental alteration – a change in the essential nature of your business – is not required. For example, a clothing store is not required to provide dressing assistance for a customer with a disability if this is not a service provided to other customers.

**Customer Assistance:** Customers with disabilities may need different types of assistance to access your goods and services:

- A grocery store clerk is expected to assist a customer using a mobility device by retrieving merchandise from high shelves
- A person who is blind may need assistance maneuvering through a store's aisles
- A customer with an intellectual disability may need assistance in reading product labels and instructions

When only one staff person is on duty, the business owner or manager should advise the staff person to assess whether he or she can provide the assistance that is needed without jeopardizing the safe operation of the business.

### Service Animals

Often businesses have policies that can exclude people with disabilities. For example, a "no pets" policy may result in staff excluding people with disabilities who use dogs as service animals. A clear policy permitting service animals can help ensure that staff are aware of their obligation to allow access to customers using service animals.

**Definition:** Under the ADA's revised regulations, the definition of "service animal" is limited to **a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability**. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability.

**Examples of Service Animal Work/Tasks:**
- Guide dogs for people who are blind or have low vision
- Alert dogs for individuals who are deaf  
- Dogs that pull wheelchairs or retrieve items for people with mobility disabilities
- Dogs that warn of imminent seizures for people with epilepsy
- Dogs that remind individuals with psychiatric disabilities to take medication
- Service members returning from war with new disabilities increasingly use service animals to assist them with activities of daily living

**Important Exclusions:** Under the ADA, "comfort," "therapy," or "emotional support animals" do NOT meet the definition of a service animal.

**Control Requirements:**
- Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents him from using these devices
- Individuals who cannot use such devices must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls

**Exclusion Criteria:**
Businesses may exclude service animals only if:
1. The dog is out of control and the handler cannot or does not regain control; or 
2. The dog is not housebroken

If a service animal is excluded, the individual must be allowed to enter the business without the service animal.

**Permitted Inquiries:**
In situations where it is not apparent that the dog is a service animal, a business may ask only two questions:
1. Is the animal required because of a disability?
2. What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?

**Prohibited Inquiries:** 
- No other inquiries about an individual's disability or the dog are permitted
- Businesses cannot require proof of certification or medical documentation as a condition for entry

### Wheelchairs and Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices

**Traditional Mobility Devices:**
People with mobility, circulatory, or respiratory disabilities use a variety of devices for mobility. Some use walkers, canes, crutches, or braces while others use manually-operated or power wheelchairs, all of which are primarily designed for use by people with disabilities. Businesses must allow people with disabilities to use these devices in all areas where customers are allowed to go.

**Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMDs):**
The term "other power-driven mobility devices" refers to any mobility device powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines, whether or not they are designed primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities for the purpose of locomotion. Such devices include Segways®, golf cars, and other devices designed to operate in non-pedestrian areas.

**Assessment Requirements:**
Public accommodations must allow individuals who use these devices to enter their premises unless the business can demonstrate that the particular type of device cannot be accommodated because of legitimate safety requirements. Such safety requirements must be based on actual risks, not on speculation or stereotypes.

**Assessment Factors:**
Businesses must consider these factors in determining whether reasonable modifications can be made to admit other power-driven mobility devices to their premises:

- The type, size, weight, dimensions, and speed of the device;
- The business's volume of pedestrian traffic (which may vary at different times);
- The business's design and operational characteristics, such as its square footage, whether it is indoors or outdoors, its placement of stationary equipment or devices or furniture, and whether it has storage space for the device if requested by the customer;
- Whether legitimate safety standards can be established to permit the safe operation of the device; and
- Whether the use of the device creates a substantial risk of serious harm to the environment or natural or cultural resources.

**Policy Development:**
Businesses are encouraged to develop written policies specifying when other power-driven mobility devices will be permitted on their premises and to communicate those policies to the public.

**Credible Assurance:**
Businesses may ask individuals using an other power-driven mobility device for a credible assurance that the device is required because of a disability. An assurance may include:
- A valid State disability parking placard or other Federal or State-issued proof of disability
- A verbal assurance from the individual with a disability that is not contradicted by observation

It is not permissible to ask individuals about their disabilities.

### Communicating with Customers

Communicating successfully with customers is an essential part of doing business. When dealing with customers who are blind or have low vision, those who are deaf or hard of hearing, or those who have speech disabilities, many business owners and employees are not sure what to do. The ADA requires businesses to take steps necessary to communicate effectively with customers with vision, hearing, and speech disabilities.

**Flexible Communication Solutions:**
The nature of communications differs from business to business, so the rules allow for flexibility in determining effective communication solutions. The goal is to find practical solutions for communicating effectively with your customers.

**Simple Communication Examples:**
- If a person who is deaf is looking for a particular book at a bookstore, exchanging written notes with a sales clerk may be effective
- If a person who is deaf is going to a doctor's office for a flu shot, exchanging written notes would most likely be effective

**Complex Communication Examples:**
- If the visit's purpose is to discuss cancer treatment options, effective communication would likely require a sign language or oral interpreter because of the nature, length, and complexity of the conversation
- The revised regulations permit the use of new technologies including video remote interpreting (VRI), a service that allows businesses that have video conference equipment to access an interpreter at another location

**Undue Burden Standard:**
It is a business's responsibility to provide a sign language, oral interpreter, or VRI service unless doing so in a particular situation would result in an undue burden, which means significant difficulty or expense. A business's overall resources determine what constitutes an undue burden. If a specific communications method would be an undue burden, a business must provide an effective alternative if there is one.

**Telephone Relay Services:**
Many individuals who are deaf or have other hearing or speech disabilities use either a text telephone (TTY) or text messaging instead of a standard telephone. The ADA established a free telephone relay network (7-1-1) to enable these individuals to communicate with businesses and vice versa. Staff who answer the telephone must accept and treat relay calls just like other calls.

**Communication with Customers Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision:**

**Simple Examples:**
- A restaurant can put its menu on an audio cassette or a waiter can read it to a patron
- A sales clerk can find items and read their labels

**Complex Examples:**
- When a client who is blind visits a real estate agent to negotiate the sale of a house, all relevant documents should be provided in a format he can use, such as on a computer disk or audio cassette
- It may be effective to e-mail an electronic version of the documents so the client can use his or her screen-reading technology to read them before making a decision

Usually a customer will tell you which format he or she needs. If not, it is appropriate to ask.

## Making the Built Environment Accessible

People with disabilities continue to face architectural barriers that limit or make it impossible to access the goods or services offered by businesses. Examples include:
- A parking space with no access aisle to allow deployment of a van's wheelchair lift
- Steps at a facility's entrance or within its serving or selling space
- Aisles too narrow to accommodate mobility devices
- Counters that are too high
- Restrooms that are simply too small to use with a mobility device

The ADA strikes a careful balance between increasing access for people with disabilities and recognizing the financial constraints many small businesses face. Its flexible requirements allow businesses confronted with limited financial resources to improve accessibility without excessive expense.

### Standards Framework

The ADA's regulations and the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, originally published in 1991, set the standard for what makes a facility accessible. The updated 2010 Standards retain many of the original provisions in the 1991 Standards, but they do contain some significant differences. These standards are used differently depending on whether a small business is:
- Altering an existing building
- Building a brand new facility  
- Removing architectural barriers that have existed for years

### Existing Facilities

#### Element-by-Element Safe Harbor

If your business facility was built or altered in the past 20 years in compliance with the 1991 Standards, or you removed barriers to specific elements in compliance with those Standards, you do not have to make further modifications to those elements – even if the new standards have different requirements for them – to comply with the 2010 Standards. This provision is applied on an element-by-element basis and is referred to as the "safe harbor."

**Safe Harbor Examples:**

- The 2010 Standards lower the mounting height for light switches and thermostats from 54 inches to 48 inches. If your light switches are already installed at 54 inches in compliance with the 1991 Standards, you are not required to lower them to 48 inches.
- The 1991 Standards require one van accessible space for every eight accessible spaces. The 2010 Standards require one van accessible space for every six accessible spaces. If you have complied with the 1991 Standards, you are not required to add additional van accessible spaces to meet the 2010 Standards.

**Safe Harbor Limitations:**
If a business chooses to alter elements that were in compliance with the 1991 Standards, the safe harbor no longer applies to those elements.

**New Requirements Not Subject to Safe Harbor:**
The revised ADA rules and the 2010 Standards contain new requirements for elements in existing facilities that were not addressed in the original 1991 Standards. These include recreation facilities such as swimming pools, play areas, exercise machines, miniature golf facilities, and bowling alleys. Because these elements were not included in the 1991 Standards, they are not subject to the safe harbor. Therefore, on or after March 15, 2012, public accommodations must remove architectural barriers to elements subject to the new requirements in the 2010 Standards when it is readily achievable to do so.

**New Requirements in the 2010 Standards Not Subject to the Safe Harbor:**
- Amusement rides
- Recreational boating facilities  
- Exercise machines and equipment
- Fishing piers and platforms
- Golf facilities
- Miniature golf facilities
- Play areas
- Saunas and steam rooms
- Swimming pools, wading pools, and spas
- Shooting facilities with firing positions
- Residential facilities and dwelling units
- Team or player seating
- Accessible route to bowling lanes
- Accessible route in court sports facilities

#### Readily Achievable Barrier Removal

The ADA requires that small businesses remove architectural barriers in existing facilities when it is "readily achievable" to do so. **Readily achievable means "easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense."** This requirement is based on the size and resources of a business. So, businesses with more resources are expected to remove more barriers than businesses with fewer resources.

**Examples of Readily Achievable Barrier Removal:**
- Providing an accessible route from a parking lot to the business's entrance
- Installing an entrance ramp
- Widening a doorway
- Installing accessible door hardware
- Repositioning shelves
- Moving tables, chairs, display racks, vending machines, or other furniture

**Compliance Standard:** When removing barriers, businesses are required to comply with the Standards to the extent possible. For example, where there is not enough space to install a ramp with a slope that complies with the Standards, a business may install a ramp with a slightly steeper slope. However, any deviation from the Standards must not pose a significant safety risk.

**Variable Assessment:** Determining what is readily achievable will vary from business to business and sometimes from one year to the next. Changing economic conditions can be taken into consideration in determining what is readily achievable. Economic downturns may force many public accommodations to postpone removing some barriers. **The barrier removal obligation is a continuing one** and it is expected that a business will move forward with its barrier removal efforts when it rebounds from such downturns.

#### Compliance Standards and Dates

| Compliance Date | Applicable Standard |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Until March 15, 2012 | 1991 Standards or 2010 Standards |
| On or after March 15, 2012 | 2010 Standards |

**Important:** Businesses removing barriers before March 15, 2012, have the choice of using either the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards. You must use only one standard for removing barriers in an entire facility.

#### Priorities for Barrier Removal

The ADA regulations recommend the following priorities for barrier removal:

1. **Priority 1:** Providing access to your business from public sidewalks, parking areas, and public transportation;
2. **Priority 2:** Providing access to the goods and services your business offers;
3. **Priority 3:** Providing access to public restrooms; and
4. **Priority 4:** Removing barriers to other amenities offered to the public, such as drinking fountains.

**Planning Recommendations:** 
- Businesses should not wait until March 15, 2012 to identify existing barriers
- Should begin now to evaluate their facilities and develop priorities for removing barriers
- Are encouraged to consult with people with disabilities in their communities to identify barriers and establish priorities

#### Alternative Service Methods

In some instances, especially in older buildings, it may not be readily achievable to remove some architectural barriers. In this situation, the business must provide its services in another way if that is readily achievable, such as providing takeout service. Businesses should train staff on these alternatives and publicize them so customers with disabilities will know of their availability and how to access them.

### New Construction and Alterations

**New Construction:** All new construction must comply with the 2010 Standards unless it is "structurally impracticable" to do so. This exception is very rare and typically applies only when the unique characteristics of terrain make accessibility unusually difficult.

**Alterations:** When a business alters its facility, the altered portions must comply with the 2010 Standards to the maximum extent feasible. If complying fully with the Standards during an alteration would be disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration (more than 20% of the cost), then accessibility improvements may be limited to the maximum amount that does not exceed 20% of the alteration cost.

**Path of Travel:** When alterations are made to a "primary function area" (areas where major activities occur), the business must also make the route to the altered area accessible, including restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the area.

### ADA Coordinator and Notice Requirements

**ADA Coordinator:** Businesses with 50 or more employees must designate a responsible employee to coordinate ADA compliance.

**Notice Requirement:** All businesses subject to Title III must provide notice to the public about their ADA obligations and how to file complaints.

## Enforcement and Legal Remedies

**DOJ Enforcement:** The Department of Justice is authorized to bring a lawsuit where there is a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of Title III, or where an act of discrimination raises an issue of general public importance.

**Private Lawsuits:** Title III may also be enforced through private lawsuits. It is not necessary to file a complaint with the Department of Justice (or any Federal agency), or to receive a "right-to-sue" letter, before going to court.

**Remedies Available:**
- Injunctive relief (court orders to comply with the ADA)
- Reasonable attorneys' fees for the prevailing party
- Civil penalties (in DOJ enforcement cases)

**Mediation Program:** In certain situations, cases may be referred to a mediation program sponsored by the Department.

## Key Business Compliance Steps

1. **Policy Review:** Review all business policies and procedures to identify barriers to customers with disabilities.

2. **Staff Training:** Train staff on:
   - Service animal policies
   - Communication techniques for customers with disabilities
   - How to provide assistance when requested
   - Emergency evacuation procedures for customers with disabilities

3. **Physical Accessibility Assessment:** Conduct a barrier removal assessment following the four priorities outlined above.

4. **Budget Planning:** Plan barrier removal over time based on business resources and readily achievable standard.

5. **Documentation:** Keep records of accessibility improvements and policy modifications.

6. **Communication Systems:** Ensure telephone systems can accommodate TTY/relay calls and consider auxiliary aids for complex communications.
