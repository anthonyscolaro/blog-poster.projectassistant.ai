## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8088/health

# Test SEO linting (working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/seo/lint -d @test-seo.json

# Test publishing (working)  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/publish/wp -d @test-input.json

# Test article generation (stubbed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/agent/run -d @topic-input.json
```

## 🔄 Next Priority Tasks

1. **Implement Article Generation Agent** 
   - Connect to Anthropic API
   - Add prompt engineering
   - Generate real content

2. **Add Jina AI Integration**
   - Competitor content scraping
   - Topic research automation

3. **Implement Vector Search**
   - Index existing content
   - Enable semantic similarity
   - Internal link suggestions

4. **Create Test Suite**
   - Unit tests for all modules
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Mock external services

5. **Production Hardening**
   - Add authentication
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Set up monitoring

## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Agent orchestration disconnected** - Workflow defined but agents not wired
2. **Mock responses everywhere** - Most endpoints return hardcoded data
3. **No error handling** - Failures crash without recovery
4. **No state persistence** - Workflow state lost on restart
5. **Cost tracking non-functional** - Models exist but not calculated

## 🎯 MVP Definition

For a true MVP, we need:
- [ ] One working agent (Article Generation)
- [ ] Real LLM integration
- [ ] Basic fact checking
- [ ] Successful WordPress publishing
- [ ] Cost tracking
- [ ] Basic tests

Current MVP completion: **~40%**
