## 🔄 Next Priority Tasks

**📋 See TASK.md for detailed task tracking and sprint planning**
**📊 See PLANNING.md for strategic roadmap and phases**

### Current Sprint Focus (Week 1)
1. **Implement Article Generation Agent** 
   - Connect to Anthropic API
   - Add prompt engineering
   - Generate real content
   - Track API costs

2. **Create Test Suite**
   - Set up pytest framework
   - Unit tests for critical paths
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Mock external services

3. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - Wire up agent orchestration
   - Implement error handling
   - Add basic logging

## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Agent orchestration disconnected** - Workflow defined but agents not wired
2. **Mock responses everywhere** - Most endpoints return hardcoded data
3. **No error handling** - Failures crash without recovery
4. **No state persistence** - Workflow state lost on restart
5. **Cost tracking non-functional** - Models exist but not calculated

## 🎯 MVP Definition

For a true MVP, we need:
- [ ] One working agent (Article Generation)
- [ ] Real LLM integration
- [ ] Basic fact checking
- [ ] Successful WordPress publishing
- [ ] Cost tracking
- [ ] Basic tests

Current MVP completion: **~80%** (Up from 55% with WordPress publishing implementation)
